I picked up game development after a long pause in 2025. I have always admired the aesthetics of 2D top-down view in games. This time I decided to make one. I built a prototype in PyGame. While I enjoyed the process, the outcome was unsatisfactory. It took a long time to just get a basic tile map with auto scroll on the screen. The lack of an authoring environment was a significant impediment. So next I searched for game engines that come with an authoring environment. Godot seemed to be the best option.

Development for Kuber began in Godot. First I decided to build the map, then design characters and finally get to coding. A set of tiles on itch.io looked really cute and matched my vision. I used those to design the first level.
